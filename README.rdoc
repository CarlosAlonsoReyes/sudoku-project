= Sudoku challenge

This project aims to establish a point of comparison between different programming languages, by solving a single problem: to solve a sudoku.
Of course they are all invited to participate in this project, so you can add more and more languages.

In future could be made metric comparison of readability, maintainability, etc..
The only prerequisite for submitting code is to establish a documented commitment to the other participants can understand the benefits that language provides.
